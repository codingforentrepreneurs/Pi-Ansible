# Pi Ansible
Learn the basics of Ansible to automate our Raspberry Pi servers on a whole new level.

Ansible is a great tool for managing servers even if you're only managing one. In this series, we're going to learn how to automate much of what we did manually in the [Pi Server](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/projects/pi-server) series.

Once we understand the fundamentals of Ansible, we can start managing servers on premise (ie locally), in the cloud, or both!
